    % 1. On mm/day/year, I received a citation in [city/county,state] for speeding. This citation was dismissed by deferred disposition/taking a defensive course (Or I paid *** fine). This violation did not cause any injury or property damage. 
%     What I did:
% 1. I submitted the pages having visa stamps and entry seal of CBP.
% 2. Write the names+ A number with a pencil (no pen/marker) on the back of the photo.
% 3. I put 2 photos with each form. I had three separate envelopes for 3 forms and put two photos in each.
% 4. Put the check on top of your I-485 form. You can probably use james clips or something. Just make sure that someone can find the check easily and quickly when they open your i-485 package. Check/payment is the first thing the USCIS center will look for.
